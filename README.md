# Introduction
This project demonstrates the steps involved in exploring and preprocessing data to make it suitable for machine learning models. The process includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and feature engineering. The datasets used are data1.csv and cars.csv.

# Project Structure
The project consists of the following key steps:
Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Handling Missing Values
Dealing with Junk Characters
Removing Outliers
Addressing Skewness
Encoding Categorical Data
Scaling Numerical Data
Feature Engineering

# Data Description
The datasets used in this project contain various features related to different domains. Key features include:
Python: Scores in Python.
Machine Learning: Scores in Machine Learning.
normalized-losses: Normalized losses in the dataset.
horsepower: Horsepower of cars.
fuel-type: Type of fuel used.
make: Make of the car.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial exploration of the dataset includes:
Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
Checking for missing values.
Understanding the distribution of data using summary statistics.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
# Handling Missing Values
There are three rules to handle missing values:
If missing values are less than 3%, drop the entire row.
If missing values are between 4-50%, fill missing values using fillna().
If missing values are greater than 50%, drop the entire column.

# Dealing with Junk Characters
Convert any junk characters into NaN values and then handle them as missing values.

# Removing Outliers
Outliers can skew the results of the analysis. Methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) are used to detect and remove outliers.

# Addressing Skewness
Skewness in data can affect the performance of machine learning models. The log transformation method is used to remove skewness.

# Handling Categorical Data
Encoding categorical variables is essential for machine learning models. Various encoding techniques used include:
One Hot Encoding
Label Encoding
Ordinal Encoding

# Data Scaling
Scaling numerical features is crucial to bring them to a common scale. Two methods are used:
Min-Max Scaler
Standard Scaler
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves extracting and organizing important features from raw data to fit into machine learning models.

# Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to performing EDA and preprocessing on datasets. The steps outlined help in cleaning and preparing the data for building efficient machine learning models. Future work could involve exploring more advanced techniques for feature engineering and model building.
